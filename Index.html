                    <h3>Ecommerce Backend</h3>
                    <p>
                        This is an Ecommerce BackEnd project where I implemented a microservices structure for core functionalities like product management, inventory, order processing, and user authentication. I used Java and Spring Boot as the backbone, integrating Elasticsearch for fast, reliable search capabilities and Azure Service Bus to enable real-time updates across services. Automation is a big part of my approach, so I developed CI/CD pipelines with GitHub Actions and Azure DevOps to streamline deployment, which significantly reduced release times.

                        <h4>API Gateway microservice</h4>
                        <p>
                            This is API Gateway for the Ecommerce BackEnd application, which is designed to manage all incoming traffic and route requests to the appropriate microservices. The API Gateway simplifies communication across services by acting as a single entry point, ensuring smooth and secure data flow within the system. It is configured to validate JWT tokens, apply role-based access, and enrich requests with user details, thus enhancing both security and scalability.

                        <h4>User Service</h4>
                        <p>
                            The User Service is a core component of the Ecommerce BackEnd application, responsible for managing user-related operations such as registration, login, and CRUD operations for user profiles. It provides the authentication and authorization backbone for the application by issuing JWT tokens on successful login, which are used to secure access to other services through the API Gateway.

                        <p>
                            The Inventory Service is a crucial part of the Ecommerce BackEnd application, responsible for managing stock levels of products. This service allows for adding, retrieving, and reducing stock quantities, ensuring that stock levels are consistently maintained and available for other services.

                    <h3>Task Management System</h3>
                    <p>
                        The Task Management System is a backend application built using Spring Boot, MySQL, Spring Security, and JWT for secure authentication and authorization. It allows users to register, log in, and manage their tasks through CRUD operations. Each user can create, view, update, and delete their tasks while ensuring that only authorized users can access their own tasks. The project implements role-based access control, where admins have full control over all user tasks. It efficiently handles user sessions using JWT tokens and follows best practices for secure and scalable backend development.
